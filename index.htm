                    <p>This is a recon-ng tool that I should have put in Linux-tools, but I think this tool is worthy of attention, even on this page.
                        Recon-ng is a recon / OSINT tool with an interface similar to Metasploit. Running Recon-ng from the command line speeds up the exploration process because it automates the gathering of information from public sources.
                        Recon-ng has many options for customizing, performing reconnaissance, and outputting results to various types of reports.
                        The interactive console provides a number of useful features such as command completion and contextual help.

                    <p>Shodan is a search engine, like Google, but instead of searching for  websites, it searches for internet-connected devices — from routers and  servers, to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as thermostats and  baby monitors, to complex systems that govern a wide range of  industries, including energy, power, and transportation.
                        Shodan can find anything that connects directly to the internet — and if your internet-facing devices aren’t protected, Shodan can tell  hackers everything they need to know to break into your network.

                    <p>If you want to look at the metadata embedded in online photos, including GPS coordinates, this is an excellent online viewer. And it is simple. Just grab the URL for an online photo, drop it into the URL box on Jeffrey’s site, verify you aren’t a robot, and then check out the tons of metadata (check out the examples below). This is the most comprehensive metadata viewer I have found.</p>

Zoomeye It's one of the search engines that allows you to search for devices, sites and services. it's a hacker search engine There was a lot of high-profile news related to Zoomeye on the web.

                    <p>Dorksearch is an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to search for specific information across search engines by utilizing advanced search queries known as "Google Dorks." Google Dorks are special search strings that allow users to uncover sensitive or hidden data on the internet, such as exposed databases, security vulnerabilities, or private documents.
                        Dorksearch automates the process of crafting and executing these queries, helping investigators and security researchers find publicly available information that might otherwise be hard to discover.

The key here is to convince them to click on a link, open an image, or document. The most harmless-looking method is using an image. You choose the "Web Image" method, upload an image to the CanaryTokens server, and provide your work email. After that, the service generates a unique token and link.</p>
